    <h1>Hello World!!</h1>
    <p>This marks the continuation of my <em>journey into coding</em>, now in its second phase. I persisted through a challenging period, working in a role that lacked meaningful tasks. My learning plateaued, and the gatekeepers of growth didn't align with my values. I devoted effort but received minimal financial reward. While I had a purpose, I lacked the necessary tools to achieve it. However, my <strong>new focus</strong> is to demonstrate the value of hard work and determination. My previous job became a limit; I had given up during my college years, resorting to shortcuts in a bootcamp by replicating code without truly understanding its core. It feels like I lost a part of my life, yet this setback offers a foundation to build upon, proving my capability to myself. I'm determined to establish a thriving career as a software engineer. To be honest, I fear failure and validating my internal doubts. However, the only way to silence these doubts is to progress and embrace failure as part of the learning process. Every experience, positive or negative, has brought me to this juncture. The only choices I have now are to move ahead or remain trapped in an endless cycle of hardship.
